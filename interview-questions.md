# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: belongs to a specific class (local var)

  Researched answer: In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data. We say that objects can: Do things.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: a set of something like an object or a class

  Researched answer: A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: i would guess that it is a command that functions inside the code but is not printed

  Researched answer: Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method. We call a method and expect some value in return. But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: as in ruby it is straight forward. Understandable why a command goes in a specific spot.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: class is a parent component that is responsible for all the objects

  Researched answer: Class: Ruby separates everything into classes. Like integers, floats and strings. Method: These are the things that you can do with an object. For example, you can add integers together, so + is a method.
